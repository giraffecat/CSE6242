0,A. Artale,cs.AI,"  A class of interval-based temporal languages for uniformly representing and
reasoning about actions and plans is presented. Actions are represented by
describing what is true while the action itself is occurring, and plans are
constructed by temporally relating actions and world states. The temporal
languages are members of the family of Description Logics, which are
characterized by high expressivity combined with good computational properties.
The subsumption problem for a class of temporal Description Logics is
investigated and sound and complete decision procedures are given. The basic
language TL-F is considered first: it is the composition of a temporal logic TL
-- able to express interval temporal networks -- together with the non-temporal
logic F -- a Feature Description Logic. It is proven that subsumption in this
language is an NP-complete problem. Then it is shown how to reason with the
more expressive languages TLU-FU and TL-ALCF. The former adds disjunction both
at the temporal and non-temporal sides of the language, the latter extends the
non-temporal side with set-valued features (i.e., roles) and a propositionally
complete language.

1,Adam Stewart,cs.CV cs.LG,"  Remotely sensed geospatial data are critical for applications including
precision agriculture, urban planning, disaster monitoring and response, and
climate change research, among others. Deep learning methods are particularly
promising for modeling many remote sensing tasks given the success of deep
neural networks in similar computer vision tasks and the sheer volume of
remotely sensed imagery available. However, the variance in data collection
methods and handling of geospatial metadata make the application of deep
learning methodology to remotely sensed data nontrivial. For example, satellite
imagery often includes additional spectral bands beyond red, green, and blue
and must be joined to other geospatial data sources that can have differing
coordinate systems, bounds, and resolutions. To help realize the potential of
deep learning for remote sensing applications, we introduce TorchGeo, a Python
library for integrating geospatial data into the PyTorch deep learning
ecosystem. TorchGeo provides data loaders for a variety of benchmark datasets,
composable datasets for generic geospatial data sources, samplers for
geospatial data, and transforms that work with multispectral imagery. TorchGeo
is also the first library to provide pre-trained models for multispectral
satellite imagery (e.g. models that use all bands from the Sentinel 2
satellites), allowing for advances in transfer learning on downstream remote
sensing tasks with limited labeled data. We use TorchGeo to create reproducible
benchmark results on existing datasets and benchmark our proposed method for
preprocessing geospatial imagery on-the-fly. TorchGeo is open-source and
available on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo.

2,Adam Stewart,astro-ph.HE,"  We investigate the relation between the radio (F_r) and optical (F_o) flux
densities of a variety of classes of radio transients and variables, with the
aim of analysing whether this information can be used, in the future, to
classify such events. Using flux density values between 1-10 GHz and the
optical bands V and R, we build a sample with a total of 12,441 F_r and F_o
measurements. The sample contains both Galactic objects, such as stellar
sources and X-ray binaries, and extragalactic objects, such as gamma-ray bursts
and quasars. By directly comparing the two parameters, it is already possible
to distinguish between the Galactic and extragalactic populations. Although
individual classes are harder to separate from the F_r-F_o parameter space to a
high accuracy, and can only provide approximations, the basic approach provides
an already useful foundation to develop a more accurate classification
technique. In addition, we illustrate how example objects from different
classes move in the parameter space as they evolve over time, offering a
feature that could be used to reduce the confusion between classes. A small,
blind test of the classification performance is also undertaken using a
catalogue of FIRST transient and variable sources, to demonstrate the
advantages and current limitations of the approach. With more multi-wavelength
data becoming available in the future, we discuss other classification
techniques which the F_r-F_o method could be combined with and potentially
become an important part of an automatic radio transient classification system.

3,Adam Stewart,astro-ph.HE,"  This chapter provides an overview of the possibilities for transient and
variable-source astrophysics with the Square Kilometre Array. While subsequent
chapters focus on the astrophysics of individual events, we focus on the
broader picture, and how to maximise the science coming from the telescope. The
SKA as currently designed will be a fantastic and ground-breaking facility for
radio transient studies, but the scientifc yield will be dramatically increased
by the addition of (i) near-real-time commensal searches of data streams for
events, and (ii) on occasion, rapid robotic response to Target-of-Opprtunity

4,Adam Stewart,astro-ph.HE astro-ph.IM,"  We present the results of a four-month campaign searching for low-frequency
radio transients near the North Celestial Pole with the Low-Frequency Array
(LOFAR), as part of the Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS). The data
were recorded between 2011 December and 2012 April and comprised 2149 11-minute
snapshots, each covering 175 deg^2. We have found one convincing candidate
astrophysical transient, with a duration of a few minutes and a flux density at
60 MHz of 15-25 Jy. The transient does not repeat and has no obvious optical or
high-energy counterpart, as a result of which its nature is unclear. The
detection of this event implies a transient rate at 60 MHz of 3.9 (+14.7, -3.7)
x 10^-4 day^-1 deg^-2, and a transient surface density of 1.5 x 10^-5 deg^-2,
at a 7.9-Jy limiting flux density and ~10-minute time-scale. The campaign data
were also searched for transients at a range of other time-scales, from 0.5 to
297 min, which allowed us to place a range of limits on transient rates at 60
MHz as a function of observation duration.

5,Adam Stewart,astro-ph.IM,"  This is the third installment in a series of papers in which we investigate
calibration artefacts. Calibration artefacts (also known as ghosts or spurious
sources) are created when we calibrate with an incomplete model. In the first
two papers of this series we developed a mathematical framework which enabled
us to study the ghosting mechanism itself. An interesting concomitant of the
second paper was that ghosts appear in symmetrical pairs. This could possibly
account for spurious symmetrization. Spurious symmetrization refers to the
appearance of a spurious source (the anti-ghost) symmetrically opposite an
unmodelled source around a modelled source. The analysis in the first two
papers indicates that the anti-ghost is usually very faint, in particular when
a large number of antennas are used. This suggests that spurious symmetrization
will mainly occur at an almost undetectable flux level. In this paper, we show
that phase-only calibration produces an anti-ghost that is $N$-times (where $N$
denotes the number of antennas in the array) as bright as the one produced by
phase and amplitude calibration and that this already bright ghost can be
further amplified by the primary beam correction.

6,Ajit P. Singh,cs.LG stat.ML,"  Relational learning can be used to augment one data source with other
correlated sources of information, to improve predictive accuracy. We frame a
large class of relational learning problems as matrix factorization problems,
and propose a hierarchical Bayesian model. Training our Bayesian model using
random-walk Metropolis-Hastings is impractically slow, and so we develop a
block Metropolis-Hastings sampler which uses the gradient and Hessian of the
likelihood to dynamically tune the proposal. We demonstrate that a predictive
model of brain response to stimuli can be improved by augmenting it with side
information about the stimuli.

task, the spectrum identification problem, in which each fragmentation spectrum
produced by a shotgun proteomics experiment must be mapped to the peptide

10,Akihiko Inoue,math.PR math.ST stat.TH,"  Some of the most important results in prediction theory and time series
analysis when finitely many values are removed from or added to its infinite
past have been obtained using difficult and diverse techniques ranging from
duality in Hilbert spaces of analytic functions (Nakazi, 1984) to linear
regression in statistics (Box and Tiao, 1975). We unify these results via a
finite-dimensional duality lemma and elementary ideas from the linear algebra.
The approach reveals the inherent finite-dimensional character of many
difficult prediction problems, the role of duality and biorthogonality for a
finite set of random variables. The lemma is particularly useful when the
number of missing values is small, like one or two, as in the case of
Kolmogorov and Nakazi prediction problems. The stationarity of the underlying
process is not a requirement. It opens up the possibility of extending such
results to nonstationary processes.

expressions for the prices of bonds and bond options. Though the model is
non-Markov, there exists an associated Markov process which allows one to apply
usual numerical methods to the model. We derive analogs of an affine term

present a numerical method to evaluate contingent claims.

12,Akihiko Inoue,q-fin.PR math.PR q-fin.RM,"  We present a general approach to the pricing of products in finance and
insurance in the multi-period setting. It is a combination of the utility
indifference pricing and optimal intertemporal risk allocation. We give a
characterization of the optimal intertemporal risk allocation by a first order
condition. Applying this result to the exponential utility function, we obtain
an essentially new type of premium calculation method for a popular type of
multi-period insurance contract. This method is simple and can be easily
implemented numerically. We see that the results of numerical calculations are
well coincident with the risk loading level determined by traditional
practices. The results also suggest a possible implied utility approach to
insurance pricing.

the Fourier coefficients of its phase function in the spectral domain. The
derivation is based on a novel alternating projection technique and the use of
the forward and backward innovations corresponding to the predictions based on
the infinite past and future, respectively. We show that such representations
are ideal for studying the rates of convergence of the finite predictor
coefficients, prediction error covariances, and the PACF as well as for proving
a multivariate version of Baxter's inequality for a multivariate FARIMA process

provides us with a linear-time algorithm to compute the finite predictor
coefficients. In the proof of the expression, a correspondence result between
two relevant matrix-valued outer functions plays a key role. We apply the
expression to determine the asymptotic behavior of a sum that appears in the
autoregressive model fitting and the autoregressive sieve bootstrap. The
results are new even for univariate ARMA processes.

its polynomial-time solvability using this connection. For this, we first show
that the dock re-allocation problem can be reformulated in the form of (MML1).
We then present a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for (MML1) based on steepest
descent approach. We also propose two polynomial-time algorithms for (MML1) by
replacing the L1-distance constraint with a simple linear constraint. Finally,
we apply the results for (MML1) to the dock re-allocation problem to obtain a
pseudo-polynomial-time steepest descent algorithm and also polynomial-time
algorithms for this problem. The proposed algorithm is based on a

corresponding Beltrami equation has a quasiconformal homeomorphism solution;
i.e. The Ahlfors-Bers Theorem in the solenoidal case. This additional condition
on the solenoidal Beltrami differentials can be written as a Banach norm in a
subspace of solenoidal differentials. Moreover, this subspace is the completion
under this norm of those solenoidal differentials locally constant at the
fiber. As a toy example, we show how this technique works on a linear problem:
We generalize the diophantine equation complex analytic extension problem to
the respective solenoidal space.

43,Alberto Verjovsky,math.CV math.AG,"  In this paper, following Grothendieck {\it Esquisse d'un programme}, which
was motivated by Belyi's work, we study some properties of surfaces $X$ which
are triangulated by (possibly ideal) isometric equilateral triangles of one of
the spherical, euclidean or hyperbolic geometries. These surfaces have a
natural Riemannian metric with conic singularities. In the euclidean case we
analyze the closed geodesics and their lengths. Such surfaces can be given the
structure of a Riemann surface which, considered as algebraic curves, are
defined over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$ by a theorem of Belyi. They have been studied
by many authors of course. Here we define the notion of connected sum of two
Belyi functions and give some concrete examples. In the particular case when
$X$ is a torus, the triangulation leads to an elliptic curve and we define the
notion of a ""peel"" obtained from the triangulation (which is a metaphor of an
orange peel) and relate this peel with the modulus $\tau$ of the elliptic
curve. Many fascinating questions arise regarding the modularity of the
elliptic curve and the geometric aspects of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil theory.

44,Alberto Verjovsky,math.DS math.NT,"  Inspired by the work of Zagier, we study geometrically the probability
measures $m_y$ with support on the closed horocycles of the unit tangent bundle
$M=\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})/\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ of the modular orbifold
$\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb Z)$. In fact, the canonical projection
$\mathfrak{p}:M\to\mathbb{H}/\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb Z)$ it is actually a Seifert
fibration over the orbifold with two especial circle fibers corresponding to
the two conical points of the modular orbifold. Zagier proved that $m_y$
converges to normalized Haar measure $m_o$ of $M$ as $y\to0$: for every smooth
function $f:M\to \mathbb R$ with compact support $m_y(f)=m_0(f)+o(y^\frac12)$
as $y\to0$. He also shows that
  $m_y(f)=m_0(f)+o(y^{\frac34-\epsilon})$ for all $\epsilon>0$ and smooth
function $f$ with compact support in $M$ if and only if the Riemann hypothesis
is true. In this paper we show that the exponent $\frac12$ is optimal if $f$ is
the characteristic function of certain open sets in $M$. This of course does
not imply that the Riemann hypothesis is false. It is required the
differentiability of the functions in the theorem.

Reidemeister moves for classical tame knots. We use the fact that a cubic knot
is determined by a cyclic permutation of contiguous vertices of the
$\mathbb{Z}^3$-lattice (with some restrictions), to describe some of the
classic invariants and properties of the knots in terms of such cyclic
permutations, by projecting onto a plane such that it is injective when
restricted to the $\mathbb{Z}^3$-lattice and the image of the

51,Alberto Verjovsky,math.DS,"  This article presents a generalization of the notion of \emph{Poincar\'e
rotation set} to homeomorphisms of the ad\`ele class group
$\mathbb{A}/\mathbb{Q}$ of the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, which is a
connected compact abelian group which can be identified with the
one-dimensional universal solenoid $\mathbf{S}$, \ie the algebraic universal
covering of the circle. The definition is first introduced in general for
homeomorphisms of $\mathbf{S}$ which are isotopic to a translation, and then
specializing in homeomorphisms of $\mathbf{S}$ isotopic to the identity, in
which case the rotation set is a closed interval contained in the base leaf
(the connected component of the identity). If in the latter case the rotation
interval reduces to a single element $\rho$ and $\rho$ is irrational (\ie it is
a monothetic generator of $\mathbf{S}$), we show that the homeomorphism is
semiconjugate to the translation $z\mapsto\rho{z}$, like in the classical
theory of Poincar\'e. This theory is valid for any general compact abelian one
dimensional solenoidal group $\mathbf{S}_G$, which are Pontryagin duals of
dense subgroups $G$ of the rational numbers with the discrete topology. These
solenoidal groups are one-dimensional laminations which are locally
homeomorphic to the product of a Cantor set by an interval so they behave very
much like a ``diffuse'' version of the circle. Our approach differs from others
because we use Pontryagin duality of compact abelian groups to define the
rotation sets.

that f = q * W where q is both C^2 and L^2 and W is the L^2 white noise on R^2.
We extend a result by Stephen Muirhead and Hugo Vanneuville by showing that,
assuming that q * q is pointwise non-negative and has fast enough decay, the
set {f > -l} percolates with probability one when l > 0 and with probability
zero if l < 0 or l = 0. We also prove exponential decay of crossing
probabilities and uniqueness of the unbounded cluster. To this end, we study a
Gaussian field g defined on the torus and establish a superconcentration
formula for the threshold T(g) which is the minimal value such that {g > -T(g)}
contains a non-contractible loop. This formula follows from a Gaussian
Talagrand type inequality.

particular for the nodal hypersurfaces corresponding to the case = 0), {f = }

correlated smooth Gaussian fields with rapid decay of correlations. The results

with a smooth density $d\mu_{\mathcal{M}}$. Let $A$ be a polyhomogeneous
elliptic pseudo-differential operator of positive order $m$ on $\mathcal{M}$
which is symmetric for the $L^2$ scalar product defined by
$d\mu_{\mathcal{M}}$. For each $L>0$, the space $U_L=\bigoplus_{\lambda\leq
L}Ker(A-\lambda Id)$ is a finite dimensional subspace of
$C^\infty(\mathcal{M})$. Let $\Pi_L$ be the spectral projector onto $U_L$.
Given $s\in\mathbb{R}$, we compute the asymptotics of the integral kernel $K_L$
of $\Pi_LA^{-s}$ in the cases where $n>ms$ and $n=ms$ respectively. Next,
assuming that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed, let $(e_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and
$(\lambda_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be the sequence of $L^2$ normalized
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $A$ where the latter sequence organized in
increasing order. Let $(\xi_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of independent
centered gaussians of variance $1$. We fix a parameter $s\in\mathbb{R}$ such
that $n\geq ms$ and consider the family $(\phi_L)_{L>0}$ of smooth random
fields on $\mathcal{M}$ defined by \[\phi_L=\sum_{0<\lambda_j\leq
L}\lambda_j^{-\frac{s}{2}}\xi_je_j\] for each $L>0$. It turns out that the
covariance function of $\phi_L$ is $K_L$. Using this information, we apply the
derived asymptotics to study the zero set of $\phi_L$. If $n>ms$ then the
number of components of the zero set of $\phi_L$ concentrates around
$aL^{\frac{n}{m}}$ for some positive constant $a$. On the other hand, if
$n=ms$, each Betti number of the zero set has an expectation bounded by
$C\ln\Big(L^{\frac{1}{m}}\Big)^{-\frac{1}{2}}L^{\frac{n}{m}}$ where $C$ is an
explicit constant. When $\mathcal{M}$ is a closed surface with a Riemmanian

$C$ equals $\frac{1}{4\pi^2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}Vol(\mathcal{M})$.

$\mathcal{D}\_p=f^{-1}([-p,+\infty[)$ where $f$ is a natural real-analytic
planar Gaussian field called the Bargmann-Fock field. More precisely, $f$ is
the centered Gaussian field on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with covariance $(x,y) \mapsto
\exp(-\frac{1}{2}|x-y|^2)$. In [BG16], Beffara and Gayet prove that, if $p \leq
0$, then a.s. $\mathcal{D}\_p$ has no unbounded component. We show that
conversely, if $p>0$, then a.s. $\mathcal{D}\_p$ has a unique unbounded
component. As a result, the critical level of this percolation model is $0$. We
also prove exponential decay of crossing probabilities under the critical
level. To show these results, we develop several tools including a KKL-type
result for biased Gaussian vectors (based on the analogous result for product
Gaussian vectors by Keller, Mossel and Sen in [KMS12]) and a sprinkling
inspired discretization procedure. These intermediate results hold for more
general Gaussian fields, for which we prove a discrete version of our main
result.
